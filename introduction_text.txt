     Body language can refer to non-verbal 
communication, such as facial expressions, 
gestures, posture/appearance/personal space, 
and voice/paralinguistics, which are the sections 
that we’ll be exploring today. Even though body 
language refers to non-verbal communication, it 
and paralinguistics makes up 93% of all 
communication, while communication through 
words only makes up 7%. Additionally, there’s 
evidence that our brains prioritize non-verbal 
communication over verbal communication. 
Intentional body language, like someone rolling 
their eyes, is easy to understand, while 
unintentional body language… not so much. It 
can be used to reveal people’s true feelings. 
     Keep in mind that the meaning of certain 
body language can vary due to cultural, 
psychological, and development differences.
