     Facial expressions can express how we’re feeling. Some universal 
expressions are happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. We can break 
down facial expressions into two sections, the eyes and the mouth. 


The eyes are frequently called the “windows of the soul” since we’re 
able to tell how someone’s feeling by looking at their eyes. 
   - When someone looks directly into your eyes during a conversation, 
     it could mean they’re interested and paying attention. 

   - When someone often breaks eye contact during a conversation, they 
     might be distracted, uncomfortable, or trying to hide their feelings.

   - When people blink rapidly, they could be distressed or uncomfortable.


   - The mouth can also reveal a lot about how someone’s feeling.
     When someone bites their lips, they can be worried, anxious, or 
     stressed.

   - Tightening lips could mean dislike, disapproval, or distrust.


Facial expressions can be interpreted in different ways. For example, 
a smile could be genuine, be a forced smile, or express sarcasm.
