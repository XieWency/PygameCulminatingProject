     Posture, appearance, and personal space are all important parts of 
body language. They can show what we’re feeling and give out impressions.

Posture:
   - 0pen Posture: when the torso is open and exposed, which can suggest 
     openness, friendliness, or willingness.

   - Closed Posture: when the torso is hidden, sometimes by crouching or 
     keeping arms and legs crossed, which can suggest anxiety, hostility, 
     or unfriendliness.

Appearance:
   - People can create interpretations based on the colours we wear. 
     This is because different colours can correspond to different moods.

   - First impressions can be based on our choice of colour, clothing, 
     hairstyle, and other factors related to appearance

Personal Space (the 4 levels of physical distance):
   - Public Distance: 12 - 25 feet
     Often used in public speaking, like talking to a class and giving 
     presentations.

   - Social Distance: 4 - 12 feet
     Often used with people you know fairly well, such as an acquaintance.

   - Personal Distance: 1.5 - 4 feet
     Often used with people you are close with, like family and friends.

   - Intimate Distance: 6 - 18 inches
     Often used with people you are really close to and have an intimate 
     relationship with.
