     Posture, appearance, and personal space are all important parts 
of body language. They can show what we’re feeling and give out 
impressions.


Posture:
   - Open posture is when the torso is open and exposed, which can 
     suggest openness, friendliness, or willingness.

   - Closed posture is when the torso is hidden, sometimes by 
     crouching or keeping arms and legs crossed, which can suggest 
     anxiety, hostility, or unfriendliness.


Appearance:
   - People can create interpretations based on the colours we wear. 
     This is because different colours can correspond to different moods.

   - First impressions can be based on our choice of colour, clothing, 
     hairstyle, and other factors related to appearance


Personal Space:
   - There are 4 levels of physical distance: public, social, 
     personal, and intimate distance.

   - Public Distance: 12 - 25 feet
          Often used in public speaking, like talking to a class and 
          giving presentations.

   - Social Distance: 4 - 12 feet
          Often used with people you know fairly well, such as an 
          acquaintance.

   - Personal Distance: 1.5 - 4 feet
          Often used with people you are close with, like family members 
          and close friends.

   - Intimate Distance: 6 - 18 Inches
          Often used with people you are really close to and have 
          an intimate relationship with.
