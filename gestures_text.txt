     Our gestures can give a pretty good idea of how we’re 
feeling. For example a clenched fist could mean anger or 
solidarity. A thumbs up, thumbs down, or the “okay” gesture 
could tell how we feel about something. The meaning of 
some gestures can also vary depending on different cultures.


Our arms and legs also can display our feelings
   - Crossed arms could mean that they feel defensive, 
     self-protective, or closed-off.

   - Clasping hands behind the back could mean that 
     they feel bored, anxious, or angry.

   - Rapidly tapping fingers or fidgeting could mean they’re 
     bored, impatient or frustrated.

   - Touch can be used to show affection, familiarity, 
     sympathy, and more.

   - Crossed legs could mean that they’re feeling closed off.
